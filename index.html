                <p>I am a mom and a school lunch lady currently studying software engineering and web development. I'm from Oklahoma, but currently live in Orem, Utah. I attend BYU Idaho online. I'm studying software engineering. I am a big fan of Lord of the rings and Dr. Strange. I have an associates degree in Multimedia Communications Technology from Utah Valley University and I worked for five years as a graphic designer for Novell. Before working at Novell I worked for Utah Valley State College as a web developer. I left the workforce to raise a family. I had three children. I decided to return to my career. I remember enjoying my web development job and I've been learning Python and Javascript for fun and I decided to return to school to study software engineering. </p>
